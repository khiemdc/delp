Initially  an  elite,  cellular  organisation  that  embedded  itself  within  safe  environments  from  which  to  plot spectacular terrorist attacks, al-Qaida transitioned into a global movement following the September 11, 2001 attacks, in part due to the loss of its Afghan safe-haven but also to take advantage of its growing name recognition. That strategy of affiliation – acquiring loyalist militant wings across the Islamic world – made up for  al-Qaida’s  loss  of  power  in  South  Asia  after  the  U.S.  invasion  of  Afghanistan,  but  it  also  presented  what  had been a centrally-led organisation with substantial challenges of command and control.",
